# MOYZA

an instant gathering service

The word "moyza" means "let's gather up" in korean.

The one who suggests would THROW a LIGHTNING,
and the one who's willing to participate would CATCH the LIGHTNING.

You can explore all the lightnings in the CLOUD.

Some rules of moyza are the following:

1. only one lighting could be thrown by a user.
2. to throw another lightning, you must delete the remaining one.
3. the lightning remains for 24 hours only.
